I Wish I Knew launches with its first episode, I Wish I Knew… How Research at Twitter Works, hosted by @BrittneyHMills, head of Revenue Diversity Research, and @ReggieMurphy, head of Creation and Conversations Research.

Throughout Episode 1, Brittney and Reggie discuss their not-so-traditional career journeys into research, how the Experience Research team at Twitter operates, and how the team delivers and measures impact within the product development process. Plus, they share advice about must-have skills for aspiring researchers.
